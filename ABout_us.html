<p><center> A school is an educational institution designed to provide </br>
learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students</br>
 (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems </br>
 of formal education, which is commonly compulsory.[2] In these systems,</br>
 students progress through a series of schools.</br> 
 The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but </br>
 generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who</br> 
 have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, </br>
 is commonly called a university college or university, </br>
 but these higher education institutions are usually not compulsory.</center></p>
